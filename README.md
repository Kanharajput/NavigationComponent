# NavigationComponent
Moving between the destination using Jetpack Navigation Component, And pass the data using safe-args.
In this app: An activity can't get to know about the the fragment is doing in the space which is provided by this 
So we can't use any button which getting fragment data without pass by the fragment Normally we get data from any of the layout or fragment
when we calling another fragment after pressinga button but if we are not opening any other layout then we can't get that layouts data 
.....I think so so after applying this to any project research it to google.
